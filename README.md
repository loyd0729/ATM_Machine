# ATM_Machine
   This was my first project/workshop from NuCamp backend bootcamp. 
   This project is an ATM Machine where the user can check balance,
   deposit, and withdraw.
 
 # Design
    The application is design for the user to register, check balance,
    deposit, and withdraw. I also added limit of invalid entry in the 
    application to exit the user out from the application when 3 
    excutive invalid attempts.
    
    Another functionality of the user when the user added or deposited a 
    certain amount the application will mailtain the current amount and 
    if the user made another deposit it will add up.
    
    Also the user can withdraw certain amount, and when the user withdraw 
    from the account, the amount that being withdraw will be subtracted 
    from the current balance. If the user withdraw more than the current
    balance the balance will be shown as a negative 
      ex. if the current balance has $200 and the user withdraw $250
          the balance will be shown as $-50. Once the user deposited 
          let $50 the -$50 balance will become $0.
   
    If the user decided to quit, the user can select the Exit option and the 
    application will be terminated.
    
 # Additional Features to be added
    I most likely going to add another feature in the application that would
    limit the max username and PIN.
